HTTP Coala
==========

Just a little bit of performance enhancing middleware -- HTTP Coala (aka Coalescer).

HTTP Coala is a middleware handler that routes multiple requests for the same URI
(and routed methods) to be processed as a single request. I don't recommend it
for every web service or handler chain, but for the computationally expensive
handlers that always yield the same response, HTTP Coala will give you a speed boost.

It's common among HTTP reverse proxy cache servers such as nginx,
Squid or Varnish - they all call it something else but works similarly.

# Usage

Example with goji

```go
// from _example/main.go ....
func main() {
	r := chi.NewRouter()

	r.Use(middleware.Logger)
	r.Use(httpcoala.Route(Route([]string{"HEAD","GET"}, []KeyTypes{Method,URI}) // or, Route([]string{"*"}, []KeyTypes{Method,URI})
	// r.Use(otherMiddleware)

	r.Get("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) // expensive op
		w.WriteHeader(200)
		w.Write([]byte("hi"))
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":1111", r)
}
```

as well, look at httpcoala_test.go


# Benchmarks

For a naive benchmark on my local Macbook pro, I used wrk with -c 100 and -t 100
on a web service that downloads an image and returns a resized version.

```
Without httpcoala middleware, Requests/sec:   7081.09
   With httpcoala middleware, Requests/sec:  18373.87
```

# TODO

* Allow a request key to be passed that determines when to coalesce requests.
  It would allow for more control such as grouping by a query param or header.
